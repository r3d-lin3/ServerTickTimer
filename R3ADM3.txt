This is just something I'm throwing together to attempt to give players of Star Citizen a way of tracking the time a server may be refreshing (Server Tick).  

This is in no way connecting to SC server and is not affiliated with Star Citizen, CIG, or any employees of it or any affiliates.

This is purely experimental!  For Science!
